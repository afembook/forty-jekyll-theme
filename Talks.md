## Decolonising History: Voices and Silences
The legacies of colonialism are multiple and complicated. For full decolonization to even be possible, we need to make ourselves aware of the extent to which our worlds have been shaped by those legacies. At this stage, systematic recognition of the colonial roots of the modern world is very limited.

Starting from Michel Trouillot’s proposition that ["any historical narrative is a particular bundle of silences"](http://www.beacon.org/Silencing-the-Past-P329.aspx), this presentation looks at how and why those historical silences may be produced. It is assumed, through theoretical work by [Veena Das](http://anthropology.jhu.edu/directory/veena-das/), [Audre Lorde](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde), and [Tillie Olsen](http://www.tillieolsen.net/), that silences do not arise accidentally, but are fashioned and produced by particular kinds of ideological and social circumstances. Colonial states have a stake in narrating the history of the world in a way that silences indigenous struggles and the expropriating, genocidal nature of so-called developed modern countries.

The following questions are at the heart of this presentation: does everyone have a voice? If not, who gets to have one? What kind of power is necessary to allow oneself a voice and silence others’? How and why are certain histories and biogr aphies silenced? Do colonial subjects have a voice historically?

Amongst other things, I will mention the anti-slavery Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804 and the deportations of the Piute peoples in the 19th century [(as narrated by Sarah Winnemucca)](http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/life_among_the_piutes/).

## Homes for People, Not for Profit
Housing is an issue that affects everyone, but it affects some people more than others. Class, gender, ethnicity and immigration status can all impact access to housing, in addition to the well-publicised generational inequalities. In this session speakers from [Living Rent](https://www.livingrent.org), [Edinburgh Student Housing Co-Op](https://edinburghcoop.wordpress.com/), and [Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth](https://housingactionsouthwarkandlambeth.wordpress.com/) will discuss responses to the housing crisis, and alternatives to housing for profit.

## Making Sense of Anarchism
What is anarchism? Why are there so many different interpretations of anarchism? Is there a basic minimum on which all anarchists must agree – and if so what is it? This discussion looks at the different theoretical approaches to understanding anarchism, the necessary differences in anarchist movements identities and practices – and explores routes for principled solidarity that avoid assumptions about a single universal definition.

## Queering Anarchism: Gender, Sexuality and Struggle 101
This talk will give an introduction to the often misunderstood question of what gender is before taking a look at the role of gender and sexuality in society. It will then look at how gender underpins capitalism and what this means in practical terms for our struggles. If you've been wondering where all the recent interest in trans peeps came from or want to understand what TERFs are and why they need to be opposed then this is the place to be. Note that the talk will touch on topics of forced surgery, transmisogyny, removal of bodily autonomy, and general discrimination against women, intersex and transgender people, however it will not dwell on these subjects.

Tanya F has a lifetime of experience with both gender and sexuality but very little experience of writing about themselves in the third person.
