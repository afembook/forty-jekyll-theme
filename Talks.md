## Making Sense of Anarchism
What is anarchism? Why are there so many different interpretations of anarchism? Is there a basic minimum on which all anarchists must agree – and if so what is it? This discussion looks at the different theoretical approaches to understanding anarchism, the necessary differences in anarchist movements identities and practices – and explores routes for principled solidarity that avoid assumptions about a single universal definition.

Benjamin Franks is the author of [Rebel Alliances: The means and ends of contemporary anarchisms](https://akuk.com/index.php?_a=product&product_id=4551) (AK Press), co-author of [Environmental Ethics and Behaviour Change](https://www.routledge.com/Environmental-Ethics-and-Behavioural-Change/Franks-Hanscomb-Johnston/p/book/9781138924055) (Routledge) and co-editor of [Anarchism: A conceptual Approach](https://www.routledge.com/Anarchism-A-Conceptual-Approach/Franks-Jun-Williams/p/book/9781138925663) (Routledge). 

## Queering Anarchism: Gender, Sexuality and Struggle 101
This talk will give an introduction to the often misunderstood question of what gender is before taking a look at the role of gender and sexuality in society. It will then look at how gender underpins capitalism and what this means in practical terms for our struggles. If you've been wondering where all the recent interest in trans peeps came from or want to understand what TERFs are and why they need to be opposed then this is the place to be. Note that the talk will touch on topics of forced surgery, transmisogyny, removal of bodily autonomy, and general discrimination against women, intersex and transgender people, however it will not dwell on these subjects.

Tanya F has a lifetime of experience with both gender and sexuality but very little experience of writing about themselves in the third person. They are an active member of the [Anarchist Federation](https://afed.org.uk), founded the Edinburgh Chapter of Action for Trans Health (Most Hated Manifesto award from Mumsnet 2017-18) and was part of the organising group for AFem2014, an International Anarcha-Feminist Conference.
