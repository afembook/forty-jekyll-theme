We want our event to be as inclusive as possible, so we have chosen a venue with good physical access throughout and have tried to plan the event with accessibility in mind. If you have any questions, or would like to suggest any further accessibility measures, please e-mail us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
If you need assistance on the day of the Bookfair, please ask one of our volunteers. There will be a staffed welcome desk in the foyer and event volunteers wearing purple “staff” badges will be stationed throughout the building. ![one of our volunteer badges]({{ "/assets/images/staff_badge.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: class="image right" }

## Ramps and lifts
*	The main door has three steps, but there is a second door immediately adjacent to it that has ramp access. 
*	Inside the building there are lifts and level access to all of the areas we will be using. 
*	All of the relevant doors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair.

## Bathrooms
*	There is a wheelchair accessible bathroom on main floor of the venue.
*	There are baby changing facilities on the main floor of the venue.
*	The upstairs bathrooms are single rooms, but the downstairs ones have cubicles - both will be designated as gender neutral on the day of the event (the single rooms are always gender neutral).

## Interaction
*	Red/yellow/green [interaction badges](http://autisticadvocacy.tumblr.com/post/94087162207/mysterium-color-communications-badges-we-want) will be provided at the welcome desk.

## Talk and workshop rooms 
*	We will designate space in both rooms for wheelchair spaces
*   There will also be designated seats for those with mobility impairments, or who may need to leave during a session.

## Session information
*	Talks and workshops will last either 50 minutes or 80 minutes, and there will be a 10 minute break between sessions.  
*	The full programme will be provided online and we will make every effort to ensure that the format is suitable for screen readers. On the day of the Bookfair the programme will be displayed on a screen at the entrance to the venue and on posters throughout the venue, but we will not provide paper copies. 

## Catering
*	Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available for a donation, and options will be provided for a range of dietary requirements.
*	Lunch will not be provided at the venue but attendees are welcome to bring food in.
*	[Euan’s Guide](https://www.euansguide.com/) can help you locate restaurants and shops near the venue that meet your access needs.

## Transport
*	Lothian Buses routes 23, 27, 41, 42 and 67 stop directly outside the venue on George IV Bridge, and routes 2, 45 and 300 stop 200m away on Chambers Street. Information on bus accessibility can be found on the [Lothian Buses](https://lothianbuses.co.uk/about-us/community/accessible-buses) website.
*	Although the venue is a short distance from Waverley Station, much of the route is uphill. 
*	Accessible taxis are widely available.
