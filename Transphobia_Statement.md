Following the events of this year's London Pride (07/07/2018), we would like to reiterate that the Edinburgh Anarchist Feminist Bookfair will be a zero-tolerance zone for expressions of transphobia. The organisers stand in absolute solidarity with all trans people, especially the trans women and trans feminine people most targeted. There is no place for transphobia in our feminism and in the class struggle.

We will not allow transphobic literature of any kind to be disseminated inside the bookfair, and we will not hesitate to remove individuals or groups that breach our policy, which can be found [here]({% link SaferSpaces.md %}).

If prior to Bookfair you have any concerns or suggestions, please feel free to contact us. Your safety and inclusion are our priority. On the day itself we will have a number of volunteers throughout the building who will be happy to act on any concerns you have.

In solidarity,
The Edinburgh Anarchist Feminist Bookfair.
