In order to make the bookfair as accessible as possible we will be providing free, professional childcare throughout the day for kids from age 6 weeks to 8 years. Booking in advance is not required, but places are not unlimited, so if you do know that you will want to make use of the crèche please let us know in advance via the contact form below. Please include the number and age of children who will be using the crèche.

## About the Crèche

Mobile crèche facilities will be provided by [Around The World Nursery](http://aroundtheworldnursery.co.uk/events-mobile-creche/), a not for profit, charitable, social enterprise based in Leith. Around the World reinvest all their surplus in the services of [Saheliya](http://www.saheliya.co.uk/), a specialist mental health and well-being support organisation for black, minority ethnic, asylum seeker, refugee and migrant women and girls (12+) in the Edinburgh and Glasgow area.
