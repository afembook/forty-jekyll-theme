## No Woman Is Safe If Prostitutes Aren’t Safe: feminism and sex worker rights

Sex worker rights are too-often caught in a trap between liberal feminist perspectives on the one hand, and carceral feminist perspectives on the other. This workshop will help participants orient sex worker rights more securely within feminist politics that are critical of both capitalism and the coercive power of the state, as well as offering concrete, practical suggestions on how to organise in solidarity with sex workers, concluding with a card-writing session to sex workers currently incarcerated for self-defence.

Molly Smith is a prostitute and sex worker rights organiser based in Edinburgh. She works with both [SWARM](https://www.swarmcollective.org/) and [SCOT-PEP](http://www.scot-pep.org.uk/), and is co-author of [‘REVOLTING PROSTITUTES: the fight for sex workers’ rights’](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2752-revolting-prostitutes), due out in October from Verso.

## Survival Pending Revolution: Building Mutual Aid

Mutual Aid is a key principle of anarchist theory. The belief, backed by much evolutionary, psychological and sociological research, that humans are naturally cooperative and that this tendency can, and must, be the basis of our social struggle and future society. 

Far from a hellish war of all against all, the absence of capitalism and the state often produces the conditions for solidarity and collaboration. Disasters, natural or political, are dreadful and we do not wish them, but even in the worst conditions we should not despair.

We'll discuss the history of mutual aid as an idea, the relation to disasters and people's natural response to them, and what we can practically do right now to build solidarity and mutual aid in our own communities.

## Understanding Autism from an Autistic Point of View

This is an autism awareness workshop with a difference. Designed and delivered by autistic people, it provides an opportunity to hear from those with first-hand experience. 

This session will explore the concept of neurodiversity (the idea that different cognitive styles are part of natural human variation) and what it means to be in the neurological minority. It aims to build understanding between autistic and non-autistic participants.
