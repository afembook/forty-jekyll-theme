## What is the Edinburgh Anarchist Feminist Bookfair?

The bookfair is an all-day event open to everybody, not just anarchists or feminists. It will provide spaces for stalls, talks, workshops, film screenings, and performances, all promoting things from an anarchist feminist perspective . We are fundraising for a professionally run crèche and will have food on hand to help with accessibility.

## How can I get involved?

If you'd like to help organise the bookfair, fundraise, or host a stall, talk or workshop, email us using the form below or at {{site.email}}

We also have a specific fundraiser for childcare at the event to allow us to provide a free, professional crèche. You can find that [here](https://fundrazr.com/91KoOa?ref=ab_27Avq2_ab_2Q6Bt6jnIMa2Q6Bt6jnIMa "Childcare Fundrazr").

## Who are we?

We are a group of anarchist feminists who have come together to organise an anarcha-feminist bookfair in Edinburgh in the summer of 2018. Some of us are already members of other groups you may be supportive of, like [Sisters Uncut](http://www.sistersuncut.org/ "Sisters Uncut"), [Edinburgh Action for Trans Health](https://edinburghath.tumblr.com/ "Edinburgh Action for Trans Health"), or [AK Press](https://akuk.com/index.php "AK Press"); others are not part of any group.
