## Who are we?

We are a group of anarchist feminists who have come together to organise an anarcha-feminist bookfair in Edinburgh in the summer of 2018. Some of us are already members of other groups you may be supportive of, like Sisters Uncut, Migrant Solidarity or SWARM; others are not part of any group.

## What is an anarchist feminist bookfair?

It's an all-day event, open to all genders but led by women, non-binary and trans people. The event will have stalls, talks and workshops, a creche, food and potentially film showings and performances.

## How can I get involved?

If you'd like to help organise the bookfair, fundraise, or host a stall, talk or workshop, email us using the form below or at {{site.email}}

We also have a specific fundraiser for childcare at the event to allow us to provide a free, professional creche. You can find that [here](https://fundrazr.com/91KoOa?ref=ab_27Avq2_ab_2Q6Bt6jnIMa2Q6Bt6jnIMa "Fundrazr").
