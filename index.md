We're excited to announce that the 2019 bookfair will be on Saturday June 29th at the City of Edinburgh Methodist Church on Nicholson Square.

Augustine United Church were a great host last year, but we hope the new venue will allow us extra space to run more sessions, offer more room for folks to relax, chat, drink a cup of tea, and hopefully provide a dedicated quiet space.

We'll be launching our new poster designs (which are bangin' btw), very soon, and we're starting to plan out this year's programme. If anyone has ideas for talks, workshops, discussions or stalls, please message us here or email us at [{{site.email}}]({{site.email}}).

And if anyone wants to get involved, we still really need more volunteers to plan the logistics, fundraise, promote the event and run everything on the day, so get in touch.

Love and solidarity, EAFB
