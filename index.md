## What is the Edinburgh Anarchist Feminist Bookfair?

The bookfair is an all-day event open to everybody, not just anarchists or feminists. It will provide spaces for stalls, talks, workshops, film screenings, and performances, all promoting things from an anarchist feminist perspective. We have **successfully** fundraised for a professionally run crèche and will have food on hand to help with accessibility.

## When is the bookfair?

The bookfair will start at 10:30 and run until 18:00 on Saturday the 21st of July, 2018.

## How can I get involved?

If you'd like to help organise the bookfair, fundraise, or host a stall, talk or workshop, email us using the form below or at {{site.email}}
~~We also have a specific fundraiser for childcare at the event to allow us to provide a free, professional crèche. You can find that [here](https://fundrazr.com/91KoOa?ref=ab_27Avq2_ab_2Q6Bt6jnIMa2Q6Bt6jnIMa "Childcare Fundrazr").~~**Update** We have now met our target for the fundraiser and will be providing a free, professional crèche, we'll have details on how to book a place soon. 

## Who are we?

We are a group of anarchist feminists who have come together to organise an anarchist feminist bookfair in Edinburgh in the summer of 2018. Some of us are already members of other groups you may be supportive of, like [Sisters Uncut](http://www.sistersuncut.org/ "Sisters Uncut"), [Edinburgh Action for Trans Health](https://edinburghath.tumblr.com/ "Edinburgh Action for Trans Health"), or [AK Press](https://akuk.com/index.php "AK Press"); others are not part of any group.
